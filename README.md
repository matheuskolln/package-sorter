# 📦 Package Sorter

[![CI](https://github.com/your-username/package-sorter/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/package-sorter/actions)
![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/sort.py%20coverage-100%25-brightgreen)

A Python solution for the **FDE Technical Screen** challenge.
The goal is to classify packages into different stacks based on their **dimensions** and **mass**.

---

# 🚀 Objective

- **STANDARD** → packages that are neither heavy nor bulky.
- **SPECIAL** → packages that are heavy **or** bulky.
- **REJECTED** → packages that are **both** heavy and bulky.

---

# 📐 Rules

- **Bulky**:
  - Volume `>= 1,000,000 cm³`
  - Or any dimension `>= 150 cm`
- **Heavy**:
  - Mass `>= 20 kg`

print(sort(100, 100, 100, 10))   # STANDARD
print(sort(200, 50, 50, 10))     # SPECIAL
print(sort(200, 200, 200, 25))   # REJECTED
```
